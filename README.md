# FFmpegUpscalerHelper
Simple program with UI for exporting video to png and encoding png images to video using FFmpeg, for the purpose of upscaling. This program does not upscale your video, it's a tool to be used to save time. Instead of opening CMD yourself and navigating to your ffmpeg location and then enter the command this program does all that for you. Saves a lot of time when working with multiple videos.

Encoding presets can be fully modified and comes with some decent default settings for x264 encodes.
.NET Framework 4.7.2 is required which should be pre-installed.
First thing you need to do to get this program to work is going into Settings and selecting the path to your ffmpeg.exe file.
The preset you have selected under Presets will be the command used when encoding the images to video.

I plan to add more features in the future, this was just something I rushed togheter quickly in 2 days and have been extremly useful for me ever since. I also plan to update this readme :)
